Description of the ancillary files:

Files:
XS_zb.txt
XS_z.txt
XS_w.txt
XSReg.m


Definitions:
nc= number of colours = 3
nf= number of light quark flavours = 5
zb=1-z=1-mh^2/s
MH2= Higgs boson mass squared= (125 GeV)^2
muf2= perturbative scale squared mu^2.

The functions G[a1,a2,…,zb] are GPLs
The functions J[a1,a2,…,zb] are iterated integrals as defined in eq. 3.28 of the paper.
The function t[i,j] are the elliptic integrals defined via eq. 3.14.




File content:
The files contain a list of lists. 
For example load into Mathematica via:
lst=Get[“XSReg.m”];

The entry 
lst[[a,b]]
corresponds to the order (a-1) of the regular coefficient function (eq.2.10) of the initial state b:
b=1: gluon guon
b=2: quark guon
b=3: quark anti-quark
b=4: quark quark
b=5: quark Quark (different flavours)

For example:
a=4, b=1
lst[[4,1]] corresponds to the regular N^3LO coefficient function for the gluon gluon initial state.


The file XSReg.m contains the analytic results.
The file XS_zb.txt contains an expansion of the regular coefficient functions around the point zb=0=1-z.
The file XS_z.txt contains an expansion of the regular coefficient functions around the point z=0.
The file XS_w.txt contains an expansion of the regular coefficient functions around the point w=0=1/2-z.
